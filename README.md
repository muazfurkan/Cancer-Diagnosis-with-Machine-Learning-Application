# Cancer Diagnosis with Machine Learning Application
This project aims to perform cancer diagnosis using a dataset consisting of lung X-ray images after applying various preprocessing techniques and training SVM, RF, and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) models.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset containing lung X-ray images for cancer diagnosis.

## Preprocessing
Various preprocessing techniques have been applied to the dataset. These preprocessing steps involve image manipulation and data preparation.

## Machine Learning Models
This project includes the training of different machine learning models such as SVM (Support Vector Machines), RF (Random Forest), and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron). These models have the ability to diagnose cancer using the features extracted from the dataset.

## Cancer Diagnosis
The trained models can be used to predict whether the lung X-ray images from the test data indicate cancer or not. This can serve as a potential diagnostic tool in the field of healthcare.
